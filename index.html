<p style="font-size:20px">Library List</p><br>
This is a project that I created using python, selenium github actions, and java script to automate a common task.<br> 
It scrapes the library web site for the books that my family has checked out then creates a web page with title and due date and creates a checklist.<br>
The java script allows sorting the books by title or due date. 
It also allows checking off the books as the are found around the house so we know we have found them all.<br><br>
