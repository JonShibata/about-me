<h2 class="section-heading">Library List</h2><br>
<p class="main-text">
This is a project that I created using python, selenium github actions, and java script to automate a common task. It scrapes the library web site for the books that my family has checked out then creates a web page with title and due date and creates a checklist. The java script allows sorting the books by title or due date. It also allows checking off the books as the are found around the house so we know we have found them all.<br><br>

<h2 class="section-heading">Fryganza</h2><br>
<p class="main-text">
When a deep frier temperature controller was malfunctioning I decided to upgrade the system. This is an arduino project using an ESP32 board configured to be a wifi access point. It serves a web page for user input and displays the current temperature. A servo motor is used to control the burners on the deep frier. <br><br>

<h2 class="section-heading">Room Monitor</h2><br>
<p class="main-text">
The idea for this project was inspired by my children who can never seem to fully close any door. One particular pet peeve of mine is the sliding door of the walk out basement. Repeatedly echoing, "Make sure the door is closed." has translated in their heads as "slam the door as hard as possible." This usually is executed as push the door as hard as possible and then let go. The door then rebounds and opens back up... despite their "best" efforts. This project aims to address the door open problem by monitoring a sensor on the door and creating an audible tone when the door is ajar. <br><br>

I realized that I would also like to prevent them from leaving the lights on the basement. I added a some light sensors to the project. To prevent false alarms during the day I needed to know if it was daylight outside. So the project connects to a google sheet that uses a web api to get sunrise and sunset times. Adding some functionality to the google sheet allowed me to send myself an email if the light was left on. To prevent false alarms a motion sensor was added to determine if someone is really in the basement. <br><br>

At some point I thought it would be a fun idea to monitor the temperature change if the door is left open in winter time. I added a temperature and humidity sensor and started pushing the data to the google sheet. <br><br>
