      <p>
        Dearest Peggy,<br><br>

        I love you so much. To me trying to love you is doing the small things to make our life together great. Many
        times I don't get it right and you still forgive me. Many times I just want to give you a million little
        wishes just to see the joy on your face. It is really the times where I see your smiling and laughing face
        that make like worth living. <br><br>

        Here's to more of that this year and here is one of my treasured memories of us together. Thanks for making
        our life together great. <br><br>

        Happy Valentine's Day. <br><br>

        May we learn to love and sacrifice like our catholic heros. <br><br>

        Love <br>
        Jon <br>
