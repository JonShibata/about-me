      ROS2 Path Follower
    </h2>
    <p class="main-text">
      This project is to increase my learning of the Robot Operating System (ROS2). This project was
      configured using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) as the platform for Ubuntu and ROS2. The intent is to
      use the standard examples using turtle sim where each turtle can publish pose data and interact with
      each other. Using the learnings the simulation has a lead turtle that performs a prescribed path. The
      lead turtle publishes its pose for the follower turtle to record as a desired path. The follower turtle
      controls its heading to follow the prescribed path. One design goal is to request input from the user
      any time the path is blocked. This user input is used to select from a given set of options for the
      follower turtle to navigate around the blockage.

      Library List
    </h2>
    <p class="main-text">
      This is a project that I created using python, selenium, github actions, and java script to automate a
      common task. It scrapes my local library's web site for the books that my family has checked out then
      creates a web page with title and due date to create a checklist. The java script allows sorting the
      books by title or due date. It also allows checking off the books as they are found around the house so
      we know we have found them all.<br><br>

      Fryganza
    </h2>
    <p class="main-text">
      While enjoying a cookout with my friends my buddy's deep frier temperature controller was malfunctioned.
      To save the day he would take a piece of ice and place it next to the thermostat. After watching his arm
      hairs look singed I decided we should upgrade the system. This is an arduino C++ project using an ESP32
      board configured to be a wifi access point. It serves a web page for user input and displays the current
      temperature. A servo motor is used to control the burners on the deep frier. <br><br>
      The parties kept growing and we decided keeping track of the temperature of multiple friers
      would be helpful. Some upgrades were made. The access point ESP32 was upgraded to accept data from a
      second arduino wifi board. Now the second temperature reporter can feed the information to the original
      board. The web page can display the data from both friers. <br><br>

      Room Monitor
    </h2>
    <p class="main-text">
      The idea for this project was inspired by my children who can never seem to fully close any door. One
      particular pet peeve of mine is the sliding door of the walk out basement. Repeatedly echoing, "Make
      sure
      the door is closed." has translated in their heads as "slam the door as hard as possible." This usually
      is
      executed as push the door as hard as possible and then let go. The door then rebounds and opens back
      up...
      despite their "best" efforts. This arduino C++ project aims to address the door open problem by
      monitoring a
      sensor on the door and creating an audible tone when the door is ajar. <br><br>

      I realized that I would also like to prevent them from leaving the lights on the basement. I added
      some
      light sensors to the project. To prevent false alarms during the day I needed to know if it was daylight
      outside. So the project connects to a google sheet that uses a web api to get sunrise and sunset times.
      Adding some functionality to the google sheet allowed me to send myself an email if the light was left
      on or the door is left open.
      To prevent false alarms a motion sensor was added to determine if someone is really in the basement.
      <br><br>

      At some point I thought it would be a fun idea to monitor the temperature change if the door is left
      open in
      winter time. I added a temperature and humidity sensor and started pushing the data to the google sheet.

      Gift Exchange
    </h2>
    <p class="main-text">
      My sister wanted to do a completely blind secret santa gift exchange. We found some sites that would
      take
      the input and generate a list, but that didn't meet the requirements of completely blind because one
      person
      still had to take the results and send them out. This project was designed to be able to generate the
      list
      and then automatically email the participants in the exchange with only the person that they were to buy
      for. <br><br>

      Over time the exchange changed to where my kids and my nieces and nephews were exchanging gifts. The
      main
      goal of the revised script was to make sure that it was randomly picked, but to account for the desire
      to
      weight is towards someone they had not gifted to in a while. <br><br>

      The initial script was written in the matlab scripting language. This version is after it was converted
      to
      python. <br><br>
